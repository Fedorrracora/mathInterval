## C++
### interval::interval\<T\>

**Description:** Stores a set of points and intervals. Supports open, closed, and infinite boundaries.
* The type T must have a comparison operator `<`

### interval::minimal\<T\> and interval::maximal\<T\>
* Represent âˆ’âˆž and +âˆž. They can be used in any function of the object.
* `interval::minimal<T>()` â€” negative infinity.
* `interval::maximal<T>()` â€” positive infinity.

## Python
### Interval

**Description:** Stores a set of points and intervals. Supports open, closed, and infinite boundaries.
* Can contain any data type, but all used objects must support the `<` operator.

### Interval_int
**Description:** Same as Interval, but accepts only integer numeric types.
Due to this, additional operations are available.

### Interval_float
**Description:** Same as Interval, but accepts only floating-point numeric types.
Due to this, additional operations are available.

### Interval_str
**Description:** Same as Interval, but accepts only strings.
Almost useless, but has its own built-in generator for the `any` function.

# Advanced Operations

All operations listed here have complexity `O(n)`.

### any()

**Description:** Attempts to find any element belonging to the given set.

In C++ only: can be called with `any(true)`. The difference is described below.

In C++, returns `std::optional<T>`, as a point may not always be found. In Python, `None` is returned in such cases.

- If a known point exists, it will be returned.
- In C++ only: If the set equals the interval (-INF, +INF) and `any()` (not `any(true)`) is called, `T{}` will be returned.
- If the set is numeric, the built-in algorithm will search for points within the set's intervals.
- If the set is a string set, the built-in algorithm will search for points within the set's intervals. Strings must contain only lowercase English letters.

### any(func1, func2, func3, x)

**Description:** Attempts to find any element belonging to the given set.

In C++, returns `std::optional<T>`, as a point may not always be found. In Python, `None` is returned in such cases.

- **func1(x)** â€“ called if there is an interval `(-INF; x)`. 
Takes one argument.
- **func2(x)** â€“ called if there is an interval `(x; +INF)`. 
Takes one argument.
- **func3(x, y)** â€“ called if there is an interval `(x; y)`. 
Takes two arguments.
- **x** â€“ result for the interval `(-INF, +INF)`.

In C++, lambdas return `std::optional<T>` and take variables of type `const T&`.
If there are no points in the given interval, `std::nullopt` can be returned.

In Python, lambdas return a variable of the appropriate type.
If there are no points in the given interval, `None` can be returned.

### custom_transfer(func)

**Description:** Transfers all elements in this set to a new set.
The transfer is handled by a lambda.

- **func(x)** â€“ called for a point or interval boundary, 
takes one argument. Returns the new value of the point or interval boundary.

`-INF` and `+INF` remain unchanged.

If the first value of an interval becomes greater than the second, the function automatically swaps them.

### custom_transfer(func, x, y)

**Description:** Transfers all elements in this set to a new set.
The transfer is handled by a lambda.

- **func(x)** â€“ called for a point or interval boundary, takes one argument. Returns the new value of the point or interval boundary.
- **x** â€“ new value for the interval boundary starting at `-INF`.
- **y** â€“ new value for the interval boundary ending at `+INF`.

If the first value of an interval becomes greater than the second, the function automatically swaps them.

### _custom_transfer(func1, func2) (C++ only)

**Description:** Transfers all elements from the data and returns a new `interval::interval`.

**Warning!:**
This function is intended for working with **raw memory**.

- **func1(x, y)** â€“ returns the new value of the interval in its original form (`std::pair<inner_type, inner_type>`).
Takes one argument `const std::pair<inner_type, inner_type>&` (previous interval value).
- **func2(x)** â€“ returns the new value of the point in its original form, takes one argument `const T&` (previous point value).
The point cannot be `-INF` or `+INF`, so it is processed in a standard way.

Here, "inner_type" is `std::pair<int, T>`.
Values of `inner_type` elements:

| Value of first | Real value                                              | Value of second                                                                          |
|---------------:|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|            `0` | `-INF`                                                  | Automatically becomes `T{}`, as `-INF` is unique, and the value of second is irrelevant. |
|            `1` | Standard value                                          | Contains the required value.                                                             |
|            `2` | `+INF`                                                  | Automatically becomes `T{}`, as `+INF` is unique, and the value of second is irrelevant. |
|          Other | **Undefined behavior** â†’ throws `std::range_error`      |                                                                                          |

Additional conditions:

- If the first value of an interval becomes greater than the second, an `std::overflow_error` is automatically generated (invalid interval).
- If the first value of an interval equals the second, that interval will not be added.

# Exceptions and Errors
## C++
### _custom_transfer(func1, func2)

- `std::range_error` if the format of inner_type is violated.

### add_interval(x, y) and remove_interval(x, y)

- `std::range_error` if the interval has a negative length.

### Operators % and %=

- `std::logic_error` if the modulus coefficient is <= 0.

### in(x, y)

- `std::logic_error` if the interval has a negative length.

## Python

### Same errors as above, but:
- `std::range_error` is replaced with `IndexError`.
- `std::logic_error` is replaced with `RuntimeError`.

### If contained objects do not have the `<` operator:
- `TypeError`
